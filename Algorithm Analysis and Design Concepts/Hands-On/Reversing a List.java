/*

Jane is a programmer and she used to participate in various coding contests. Since she is very much interested in data structure, she planned to participate in a contest for 
data structures conducted by 'Secrets of Champions'. In that contest, she is asked to write a program in Java to perform following operations:

Define a Class with following format:
class Node
{
    int data;
    Node  next;
}

Include functions:
append --- to add data at the end of the linked list.
Reverse --- to reverse the linked list.
display --- to display all the data in the linked list.

How can you help her to write this code?

Note: Implement the main() inside the class 'List'

Input and Output Format:
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input and Output:
Enter the value:
9
Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No
yes
Enter the value:
10
Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No
Yes
Enter the value:
26
Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No
Yes
Enter the value:
8
Do you want to add another node? Type Yes/No
no
The elements in the linked list are: 9 10 26 8
The elements in the reversed linked list are : 8 26 10 9

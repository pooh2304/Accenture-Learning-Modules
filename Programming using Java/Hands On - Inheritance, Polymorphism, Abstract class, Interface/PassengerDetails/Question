Indian Railways is a state owned national transporter, responsible for rail transport in India. It is owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of
Railways. Railway ticket generation  happens using dot matrix printer. For example, the reservation chart that is stuck outside the train, has multiple copies. One copy goes
to the head office, one to the ticket checker, one on the platform and one the train. The multiple copies are printed simultaneously and with the help of the dot matrix 
printer.

Create an application which is used to print the passengers details.

Consider a class Passenger with the following private variables:
  int ticketid
  String name
  String gender
  String address
Initialize the values using constructor and display the details as generated by dot matrix printer.
[Hint : override the "public String toString()" method]

Write a class Main to get the input from the user as shown in the sample below and print the details of the passenger by using the overridden toString method.

Sample Input 1:
Enter the no.of passengers:

Passenger 1
Enter the ticketid:

Enter the gender:

Passenger 2
Enter the ticketid:

Sample Output 1:

ticketid:101,name:Bavi,gender:Female,address:Bangalore

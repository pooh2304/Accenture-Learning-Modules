EPFO is the world's largest Social Security Organisation in terms of clientele and the volume of financial transactions undertaken. At present it maintains more than 
10 crore accounts pertaining to its members across 122 locations in India. The regional office of Tamilnadu wants to maintain the provident fund details of the employee 
who has been working as full time (permanent),so that it would be easy to claim the PF online.Help them to calculate pf. 

Create a public class Employee with the following private variables:
  String name
  float salary
  float netsalary
Write the necessary public getters and setters.

Create a public class PermanentEmployee (which should inherit Employee) with the following private varibles:
  float pfpercentage
  float pfamount
Write the necessary public getters and setters.

Implement a method void findNetSalary() in the PermanentEmployee class which calculates pfamount and deduct it from the salary to find the net salary and set the pf amount
and netsalary to the attribute.

Salary should not be less than or equal to zero and pf % should be a valid positive number,it can be zero. 

Ensure the values given meet the criteria using the method boolean validateInput(), which has to be defined inside the class PermanentEmployee. Check for the salary and 
pf percentage validity.  If valid, return true.  Else, return false.

Create a class Main and write the main method.

In the main method, before invoking the findNetSalary method, validate the input by invoking the validateInput method.  If the input is invalid display error message as 
"Error!!!  Unable to calculate the NetSalary." else display the net salary as shown in the sample.

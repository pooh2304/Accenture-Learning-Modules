Create a public Functional interface, Calculate with the below method:
  float performCalculation(int a,int b);

Write a public class Calculator with the below methods:
  public static Calculate  performAddition()  -  The lambda expression  for the performCalculation method must return the sum of the parameters passed.
  public static Calculate  performSubtraction()  -  The lambda expression  for the performCalculation method must return the difference of the parameters passed.
  public static Calculate  performProduct()  -  The lambda expression  for the performCalculation method must return the product of the parameters passed.
  public static Calculate  performDivision()  -  The lambda expression  for the performCalculation method must return the division of the parameters as a / b.

Write the main method in Calculator class.
  -  Get the values of  a and b. 
  -  Invoke the static methods in the main to perform the calculation.
  -  Capture the object of Calculate that is returned by the static method.
  -  Invoke the performCalculation method for the inputs  received from the user.
  -  Display the result.

Note  :  Implement all the static methods mentioned above using lambda expression.  Donâ€™t create object for the interface using new keyword.

Sample Input 1 :
10
20

Sample Output 1 :
The sum is 30.0
The difference is -10.0
The product is 200.0
The division value is 0.5

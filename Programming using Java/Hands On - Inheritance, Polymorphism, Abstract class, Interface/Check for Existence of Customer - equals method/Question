Uninor, one of the mobile network operators offers free network for the customers. Before making use of this offer the customer should get enrolled with this network. 
One customer can get enrolled only once. 

Now, Uninor needs an application to check whether the customer who enrolls already  exists or not. Develop a program to implement the concept by taking the input for two
customers and compare if they are same.

Create a  public class Customer with the private attributes:
  String name
  String panno
  String emailid
  int salary
Include appropriate public getters and setters. 

Write a 4 argument constructor with arguments - name, panno, emailid and salary.

Note :
  If the emailid and panno are same, then customer is an existing customer.
  Override the equals method to check  for the existence of customer. 

Create a class Main with the main method. In the main method get the input for 2 customers as shown in the sample input. Compare the 2 objects using the overridden equals
method and print the output as "Both the objects are equal.", if the objects are equal. Else, display  "Both the objects are not equal."

Refer the samples given, to read and display the data.

Sample Input 1:

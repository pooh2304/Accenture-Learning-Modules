You are asked to create an application that calculates area for various shapes.

Create a class Shape and declare a public method double calculateArea() (as abstract). 

Create classes like Circle, Rectangle and Triangle and provide the implementation of calculateArea for all the shapes.

Use the following private attributes
  For circle : float radius
  For Rectangle : float length, float breadth
  For Triangle : float base, float height;
  
Create a class Main, where we do all the input and output operations. Display the area correct to 2 decimal places.

Write the constructor for these classes as :
  For Circle - 1 argument constructor that takes radius as parameter
  For Rectangle - 2 argument constructor that takes length and breadth as parameter
  For Triangle - 2 argument constructor that takes base and height as parameter

Note : Use Math.PI to take the PI value to calculate the area of circle.

Refer the Sample input and output.

Sample Input 1: 
Enter the shape :
Circle
Enter the radius :
6

Sample Output 1:
The area of Circle is : 113.10


Sample Input 2:
Enter the type of shape :
Rectangle
Enter the length :
21
Enter the breadth :
15

Sample Output 2:
The area of Rectangle is : 315.00


Sample Input 3:
Enter the type of shape :
Triangle
Enter the base :
14
Enter the height :
10

Sample Output 3:
The area of Triangle is : 70.00

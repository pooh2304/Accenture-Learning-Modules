Sarah got confused to calculate volume of cylinder and cuboid. Write a Java application to help Sarah to do this.

Create a class called VolumeCalculator that has the following methods:
  double calculateVolume(double radius,double height) - This method calculates the volume of the cylinder using the formula 3.14*radius*radius*height.
  double calculateVolume(int length,int breadth,int height) - This method calculates the volume of the cuboid using the formula length*breadth*height.

Write a TestMain class to test the application.

Sample Input 1:
Enter the choice
1.Find Volume For Cylinder
2.Find Volume For Cuboid
1
Enter the radius
3
Enter the height
2

Sample Output 1:
Volume of the Cylinder is 56.52


Sample Input 2:
Enter the choice
1.Find Volume For Cylinder
2.Find Volume For Cuboid
2
Enter the length
3
Enter the breadth
2
Enter the height
1

Sample Output 2:
Volume of the Cuboid is 6.00

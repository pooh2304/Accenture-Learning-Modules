Get the date of joining(as String) as input from the user.  Calculate the number of years of experience and display the same.

Assume:
1) The given date is a valid date and the format is dd/MM/yyyy.
2) The current date is 15/12/2020.

Sample Input 1:
21/8/2006

Sample Output 1:
14 years

Hint : Create two Date objects- one for the input date and other for the current date. (Say d1 and d2). Find the difference between these two dates in milliseconds as
       d2.getTime() -  d1.getTime().

Convert this milliseconds to number of years.

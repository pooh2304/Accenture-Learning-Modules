Develop a smart application as Student Grade Calculator(SGC).

Create a class Student with following private attribute :
  int id, String name, marks(integer array), float average and char grade. 
Include  getters and setters methods for all the attributes.

void calculateAvg()- This method should calculate average and set average mark for the current student.
void findGrade()- This method should set the grade based on the average calculated.

All marks should be greater than or equal to 50 to calculate the grade. If one or more marks is below 50 the grade should be set as 'F'. If all marks are 50 and above, 
set the grade based on below condition, 

If the average is between 80 and 100 then, then return grade as 'O'. If the average is between 50 and 79 then return the grade as  'A' .If the average of the student is  
less than 50 then return grade as 'F'. average and grade attribute should be set with the appropriate values.

(Note : Assume the number of subject is  greater than zero and  the mark for a subject is in the range of 0 - 100.)

Write a class StudentMain and test the application.
